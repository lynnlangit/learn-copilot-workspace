# Learn Copilot Workspace: FizzBuzz Implementations

Welcome to the Learn Copilot Workspace repository, where we explore the classic FizzBuzz problem through implementations in multiple programming languages. This repository serves as a demonstration and learning resource for those interested in seeing how different languages approach the same problem.

## FizzBuzz Implementations

The FizzBuzz problem is a simple programming task often used in software development interviews. In this repository, you will find implementations of FizzBuzz in the following programming languages:

- C++ (`FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.cpp`)
- C# (`FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.cs`)
- Java (`FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.java`)
- JavaScript (`FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.js`)
- Python (`FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.py`)
- R (`FizzBuzz/fizzbuzz.r`)

Each implementation follows the basic rules of FizzBuzz: for numbers 1 through 100, print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both, and the number itself for all other numbers.

## Test Files

To ensure the correctness of each FizzBuzz implementation, this repository also includes test files for each programming language:

- C++ (`FizzBuzzTests/fizzbuzz_test.cpp`)
- C# (`FizzBuzzTests/fizzbuzz_test.cs`)
- Java (`FizzBuzzTests/fizzbuzz_test.java`)
- JavaScript (`FizzBuzzTests/fizzbuzz_test.js`)
- Python (`FizzBuzzTests/fizzbuzz_test.py`)
- R (`FizzBuzzTests/fizzbuzz_test.r`)

These test files are designed to verify that each implementation correctly handles the FizzBuzz logic for the specified range of numbers.

## Additional Files

This repository also contains a `.gitignore` file, which specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore, and a `LICENSE` file. The `LICENSE` file contains the terms under which the software is licensed, in this case, the Apache License 2.0. This license is a permissive free software license that allows users considerable freedom with the software while still protecting the original author's copyright.
